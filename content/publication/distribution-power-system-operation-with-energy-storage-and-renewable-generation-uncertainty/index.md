abstract: "The need for secure and flexible operation of distributed power
  systems and the decline in prices for Li-ion batteries have made energy
  storage deployment a viable option. The electric energy storage units’
  characterization (including Li-ion batteries) currently utilized for power
  system operation and planning models relies on two major assumptions: the
  charge and discharge efficiencies are constant during such processes, and the
  maximum charge and discharge rates are independent of the system’s state of
  charge. This approach can lead to an over- or underestimation of the available
  power and energy for supporting services such as frequency response and load
  balancing; thus, threatening the overall system reliability. In this chapter,
  we introduce an optimal stochastic operation model for distribution systems
  with energy storage. We, firstly, present the power flow formulation for
  distribution networks and derive its equivalent second-order conic
  reformulation. Secondly, we introduce an ideal energy storage model and a new
  detailed linear model for the state-dependent characterization of the unit’s
  charge and discharge processes. Finally, we integrate the proposed model into
  a deterministic and stochastic economic operation model of a distribution
  power grid to illustrate the benefits of a detailed battery characterization,
  in comparison with the existing constant efficiency approach. The proposed
  energy storage models are computationally compared on a modified IEEE 33-bus
  electric distribution system."
